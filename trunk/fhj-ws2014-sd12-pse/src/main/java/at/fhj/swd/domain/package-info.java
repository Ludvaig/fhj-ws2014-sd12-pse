/**
 * Domain Layer<br>
 * <p>
 * The business logic is the work that an application needs to do for the
 * domain we are working with. It involves calculations based on inputs
 * and stored data and validation of any data that comes in from the
 * presentation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <b>TODO:</b>
 * <p>
 * I'm not totaly sure if stuff like utils and global constants are part of the domain layer.
 * Change package if it comes out its wrong!
 * </p>
