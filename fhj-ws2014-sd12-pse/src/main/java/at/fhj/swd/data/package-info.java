/**
 * Data Source Layer<br>
 * <p>
 * Data source logic is about communicating with other systems that
 * carry out tasks on behalf of the application. For most enterprise
 * applications the biggest piece of data source logic is a database that
 * is primarily responsible for storing persistent data.
 * Sometimes the layers are arranged so that the domain layer
 * completely hides the data source from the presentation. More often,
 * however, the presentation access the data store directly.
