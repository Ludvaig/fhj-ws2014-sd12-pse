/**
 * Presentation Layer<br>
 * <p>
 * Presentation logic is about how to handle the interaction betwenn
 * the user and the software. This can be as simple as a commandline,
 * a rich-client graphics UI or a HTML-based browser UI.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <b>TODO:</b>
 * <p>
 * We should change the view helper classes into controller! See feedback from
 * iteration 1.
